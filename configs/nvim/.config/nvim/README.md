Press the "Use this template" button above to create a new repository to store your user configuration.

You can also just clone this repository directly if you do not want to track your user configuration in GitHub.

#### Clone the repository

```shell

```

#### Start Neovim

nvim
```

Update the each plugin's lua file with the spec, use supermaven.lua as an example.
Each plugins keymaps must be in this format:

specs = {
{
"AstroNvim/astrocore",
opts = {
mappings = {
i = {
....
...

Move all the keymaps in astro_core.lua to each plugin's lua file using the above method.
